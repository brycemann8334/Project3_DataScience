# NBA Data Analysis
### Bryce Mann
#### Datasets
I plan to use data collected by the NBA that is kept on stats.nba.com. To access this data I will be using 2 different python libraries developed to make pulling this data as easy as possible: nba_api by swar and nba_py by seemethere on github. The NBA already makes this data publicly accessible, not to mention that a lot of it is published online and published in the media so I don't think there are any major privacy or ethical concerns with using and presenting these datasets.

#### Explorations
My main goal for this project is to get more comfortable with machine learning, so my main goal for this project is to use the scikit-learn python library to maybe be able to classify players into their positions based on their stats, predict a team's season record based on their players' season-long performance, look at how the league's increased focus on 3-point shooting has changed over time. There are a bunch of other directions I could take this, so it will just take some time playing around with the data to see what else could be done.

#### Stretch Goal
In recent years, advanced statistics (True Shooting Percentage, Player Efficiency Rating, etc.) have completely changed the way front offices evaluate talent and how casual fans view the game. Time permitting, I want to explore some of the current advanced metrics, see what shortcomings they might have, and potentially create a new/modified advanced metric that has some use in talent or performance evaluation.
